    <h1>Kyiv-style cutlets</h1>
    <p>Together with <em>borsch</em> and <em>varenyky</em>, Kyiv cutlet is one of the most famous dishes of Ukrainian cuisine in the world. Tender meat in crispy breading can be found in the menu of many expensive restaurants on the planet. Kyiv cutlet is rightfully the pride of Ukraine. Unlike the usual cutlets, this dish is made from a whole piece of chicken, not minced meat. The main highlight of the Kyiv cutlet is a liquid filling with aromatic oil.</p>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter - 140 g</li>
        <li>Chicken - 1.2 kg</li>
        <li>Parsley - 20 g</li>
        <li>Salt - 0.5 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Chicken egg - 2 pcs</li>
        <li>Milk - 100 ml</li>
        <li>Wheat flour - 60 g</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs - 140 g</li>
        <li>Butter - 50 g</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil - 300 ml</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cut the chicken without skin into two pieces of breast fillet together with the humerus on the leg. Put the fillet with the inner side up, cut from the middle lengthwise in both directions, put the halves so that the filling fits, beat off with a hammer. Carefully remove the white tendons.</p>
    <p>In a bowl, mix chopped parsley, melted butter and salt until smooth. Divide the mixture into two parts and put in the freezer for 5 minutes. Then put the stuffing in the fillet, wrap it tightly and put it back in the freezer for 5 minutes.</p>
    <p>Beat eggs with milk in a bowl separately. Roll cutlets in flour, then in egg mixture, in breadcrumbs, then in mixture, then in breadcrumbs again. Pour oil into a frying pan and heat to 200 degrees. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Fry the cutlets in deep fat until golden brown (about 5 minutes), then bring to readiness in the oven for 10 minutes. Put on a napkin to absorb the fat before serving.</p>
