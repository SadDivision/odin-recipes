    <h1>Ukrainian borsch</h1>
    <p>     Borsch is a cultural heritage of Ukraine, our pride and culinary symbol of our country.It is simply impossible to be indifferent to this thick rich soup.</p>

    <p>     There are many recipes of borsch and almost every family has its own.
    Someone likes borsch with beans, someone cooks without cabbage, and someone cooks it with mushrooms.
    Quite often, borsch recipes in families are carefully passed down from generation to generation,
    and some are even kept in strict secrecy.</p>
