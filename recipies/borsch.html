    <h1>Ukrainian borsch</h1>
    <p>     Borsch is a cultural heritage of Ukraine, our pride and culinary symbol of our country.It is simply impossible to be indifferent to this thick rich soup.</p>

    <p>     There are many recipes of borsch and almost every family has its own.
    Someone likes borsch with beans, someone cooks without cabbage, and someone cooks it with mushrooms.
    Quite often, borsch recipes in families are carefully passed down from generation to generation,
    and some are even kept in strict secrecy.</p>
    <strong>Ukrainian borsch</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Water - 1.5-2 liters</li>
        <li>pork or beef on the bone - 400 g</li>
        <li>potatoes - 4 pcs. (medium)</li>
        <li>beets - 2 pcs. (small)</li>
        <li>carrot - 1 pc.</li>
        <li>onions - 3 pcs. (medium)</li>
        <li>fresh white cabbage - 300 g</li>
        <li>tomato paste - 2 tbsp. </li>
        <li>sunflower oil - 4-5 tbsp. </li>
        <li>citric acid - a pinch</li>
        <li>salt, bay leaf, herbs - to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <p>First, cook the broth. Pour 1.5-2 liters of water into a saucepan. Add the meat and put on medium heat. Remove the foam before boiling. As soon as the broth boils, cover with a lid and cook on low heat for an hour and a half.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, prepare the roast. Peel beets, carrots and onions. Grate beets on a coarse grater and carrots on a medium grater. Cut the onion into cubes.</p>

    <p>Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat, add onions and carrots, fry for 5 minutes. Then add beetroot (you can sprinkle it with citric acid or sprinkle with fresh lemon juice - so the borsch will be really red). Fry vegetables for another 5 minutes, add tomato paste, stir and fry for another 5-7 minutes.
    And now cook the borsch itself. Take the meat out of the broth and while it is cooling, add chopped cabbage to the broth. After 5-10 minutes add the potatoes cut into strips. Separate the meat from the bone and cut into cubes. Return the meat to the borsch, salt it and add the roast. Stir the borsch, add bay leaf and finely chopped herbs, cover and cook for another 5-7 minutes.</p>

    <p>Serve borsch with sour cream and herbs.</p>
